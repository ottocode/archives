\section{Introduction}
This software design document provides a description of the \texttt{ConMan} application.  In addition to describing the basic user interface design, the client-server interface and database description are also provided here.

The purpose of \texttt{ConMan} is to provide a simple, web-based task-management application that can be used by both individuals and teams.
The user interface should be easy to learn without hiding any of the core features of \texttt{ConMan}.

\newpage
\section{Architectural Design}
\subsection{Overview}
\texttt{ConMan} is divided into two major components: the client-side user interface, and a server-side application and database.
The client-side communicates with the server using HTTP requests sent through an internet browser.  
\texttt{ConMan} utilizes the Client-Server architecture and allows multiple clients to concurrently access the server.  

\subsection{Client-Server Interaction}
Data and user interactions are passed between the database, server, and clients through a MVC architecture.

The \texttt{ConMan} database will maintain the data for the \texttt{ConMan} application.  
The database will have no direct interaction with the clients and is only accessible through an interface with the server.
Requests made to the database will occur in a First-Come, First-Served manner in order to preserve data consistency.

The \texttt{ConMan} server parses HTTP requests made by the clients and will interface with the database as needed.  
The server itself will be stateless and will not maintain user or application data after a request is handled.
Data passed between the client and server will be in the JSON format.

\subsection{Basic Context}
The "basic context" of \texttt{ConMan} is where a user can only take actions that affect their personal account.
Every \texttt{ConMan} user has a basic account, and consists of the tasks and checklists that are not a part of external teams or groups.
When a user opens the \texttt{ConMan} application by pointing their browser to the \texttt{ConMan} URL, the initial user context is the basic context.
The basic context is also the starting context when an account is created.


\subsubsection{Interface Description}
Fields entirely enclosed in [] brackets are to be considered optional.
\begin{lstlisting}
CreateAccount(  LastName:String,
                FirstName:String,
                E-mail:String,
                Password:String);
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
ModifyAccount(  UserId:Int,
                [LastName:String],
                [FirstName:String],
                [E-mail:String],
                [NewPassword:String],
                OldPassword:String);
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
CreateTask( UserId:Int,
            TeamId:Int,
            DueDate:date,
            Description:String);
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
ModifyTask( UserId:Int,
            TaskId:Int,
            TeamId:Int,
            [DueDate:date],
            [Description:String],
            [Completed:Boolean],
            [Note:String]);
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
CreateChecklist(    UserId:Int,
                    TeamId:Int,
                    TaskId:Int,
                    DueDate:date,
                    Fields:[{CheckListId:Int, FieldId:Int DueDate:date, Description:String}],
                    Description:String);
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
ModifyChecklist( UserId:Int,
                 CheckListId:Int,
                 TaskId:Int,
                 [DueDate:date],
                 [Description:String],
                 [Fields:[{CheckListId:Int, FieldId:Int DueDate:date, Description:String}]],
                 [CompletedField:Boolean[]],
                 [Completed:Boolean],
                 [Note:String]);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Processing Details}
The \texttt{CreateAccount} interface is used when the user first creates an account with the \texttt{ConMan} system.
The server will validate the input fields given by the user.
If all fields are valid, the server will update the database records and add a new user.
A team is automatically generated with a team-Id equivalent to the user-Id.
If the server successfully validates the user fields and successfully updates the database, the user-Id generated by the database will be returned.
Otherwise, an error code will be returned.

\texttt{ModifyAccount} functions similarly to \texttt{CreateAccount}, except fields that \texttt{NULL} can be given for fields that are not being updated and are not required to identify the action.

\texttt{CreateTask} adds a new task for the user. 
In the basic context, the \texttt{TeamId} will be the \texttt{UserId}. 
After verification by the server and a successful database update, the task-Id will be returned.
Otherwise, an error code will be returned.

\texttt{ModifyTask}, like \texttt{ModifyAccount} allows texttt{NULL} values to be given for fields that are not being updated.
A success or error code will be returned.

\texttt{CreateChecklist} will add a checklist to a task owned by a user.
In the basic context, the \texttt{TeamId} will be the \texttt{UserId}.

\texttt{ModifyChecklist} This interface function is invoked to modify an existing checklist.
 
\subsubsection{Restrictions/Limitations}
For every interface action, the server must validate the given fields against the database to ensure the user making the request has the appropriate permissions.
\subsubsection{Performance Issues}
Requests made by the clients to the server are subject to time-out restrictions.  
If the server takes too long to process an interface request and the client-server connection is ended, the client will assume the transaction failed.
Under such a failure condition, the client will send a "revoke" notice to the server indicating that any database changes made on behalf of the timed-out request must be rolled-back.
\subsubsection{Design Constraints}
In order to maintain data consistency, either only one database should be used, or a very robust data-duplicating effort must be made to ensure consistency across multiple databases.  
Version one of \texttt{ConMan} will only support a single database back-end.

\subsection{Team Context}
The team context is conceptually very similar to the basic context, except administrator privileges are required to modify the team account.
Administrator privileges are automatically given to the creator of a team.
Tasks associated with the team can be modified by all team administrators and all users belonging to the team who have been assigned to the task.

\subsubsection{Interface Description}
Fields entirely enclosed in [] brackets are to be considered optional.
\begin{lstlisting}
CreateTeam(     TeamName:String,
                E-mail:String,
                Password:String);
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
ModifyTeam(     TeamId:Int,
                [TeamName:String],
                [E-mail:String],
                [NewPassword:String],
                OldPassword:String);
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
CreateTeamTask( UserId:Int,
                TeamId:Int,
                AssignedUsers:Int[],
                DueDate:date,
                Description:String);
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
ModifyTeamTask( UserId:Int,
            TaskId:Int,
            TeamId:Int,
            [AssignedUsers:Int[]],
            [DueDate:date],
            [Description:String],
            [Completed:Boolean],
            [Note:String]);
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
CreateTeamChecklist(    UserId:Int,
                        TeamId:Int,
                        TaskId:Int,
                        AssignedUsers:Int[],
                        DueDate:date,
                        Fields:[{CheckListId:Int, FieldId:Int DueDate:date, Description:String}],
                        Description:String);
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
ModifyTeamChecklist( UserId:Int,
                 CheckListId:Int,
                 TeamId:Int,
                 TaskId:Int,
                 [AssignedUsers:Int[]],
                 [DueDate:date],
                 [Description:String],
                 [Fields:[{CheckListId:Int, FieldId:Int DueDate:date, Description:String}]],
                 [CompletedField:Boolean[]],
                 [Completed:Boolean],
                 [Note:String]);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Processing Details}
The processing details for the team context differ from the basic context only in the fact that an additional check must be performed to ensure the user making the request has the correct team permissions to do so.
\subsubsection{Restrictions/Limitations}
There are no additional restrictions or limitations.
\subsubsection{Performance Issues}
There are no additional performance constraints.
\subsubsection{Design Constraints}
There are no additional design constraints.

\section{Data Design}
Server-side databases provide persistent data storage for the \texttt{ConMan} application.
When a user connects to the \texttt{ConMan} application through a web-browser, the data associated with that user is retrieved by the server from the database and sent as a JSON encoded string back to the user for client side processing.
To preserve consistency, client side processing will only include data representation (visual effects).
Any create, update, or destroy operations on the data must be validated by a server request (interfaces defined below).

All data held outside of the database - client and server-side -  will be not be preserved by the \texttt{ConMan} application when the user navigates away from the \texttt{ConMan} page.

\subsection{Database Design}
The following database table descriptions describe the data interactions and dependencies.

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline
    \textbf{User Table} \\ \hline
    UserId:Int (unique)\\
    LastName:String\\
    FirstName:String\\
    Email:String\\
    Password:String\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\hfill
\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline
    \textbf{Team Table} \\ \hline
    TeamId:Int (unique)\\
    TeamName:String \\
    TeamEmail:String\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline
    \textbf{Team Member Table} \\ \hline
    TeamId:Int\\

\newpage
\section{User Interface}
The user interface of \texttt{ConMan} is dominated by the use of the "main screen" (shown below).  
The main screen consists of four distinct parts, the top bar, the bottom bar, the left pane, and the content area.
A general overview of some of the user interface designs follows.

\subsection{Main Screen}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[trim = 0cm 14cm 0cm 0cm, clip=true, scale=0.7]{images/mainscreen}
\end{center}
As can be seen here, the top and bottom bars are populated with navigational tools.
The left pane allows the user to select which context they would like to operate in (personal or team context) and displays options relating to the selected context.
The content area then has three primary views
\subsection{Content Area}
\subsubsection{Calendar View}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[trim = 0cm 14cm 0cm 0cm, clip=true, scale=0.7]{images/calendarview}
\end{center}
The calendar view gives the user an opportunity to see when the tasks and checklists he is assigned are due.
If the user has selected the personal context in the left pane, then only the personal context tasks will be displayed.
The tasks and checklists appearing in the calendar will be hyper-links that navigate the content area to the task or checklist view respectively.
\subsubsection{Task View}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[trim = 0cm 12cm 0cm 0cm, clip=true, scale=0.7]{images/taskview}
\end{center}
The task view will show the task name, description, checklists, notes, and available actions for the selected task.
For tasks which are assigned to teams, non-administrative users will not be able to perform every action (namely deleting a task).
Non-administrative users will still be able to see the administrative actions, but the action link will be obscured (usually grayed out).
\subsubsection{Checklist View}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[trim = 0cm 12cm 0cm 0cm, clip=true, scale=0.7]{images/checklistview}
\end{center}
A checklist is conceptually very similar to a task and displays similar items.
Again, not every action will be available to non-administrative users.
\newpage
\section{Restrictions, Limitations, and Constraints}
As detailed in the SRS, the user interface will only be supported for the Chrome and FireFox desktop web-browsers.
Future versions of \texttt{ConMan} could add support more browsers and devices.

An internet connection is also required to use \texttt{ConMan}, and there are no plans to implement off-line support.
Because \texttt{ConMan} is intended to assist coordination between teams (particularly software development teams), a network connection is essential.
\newpage
\section{Testing Guidelines}
Testing will be integrated throughout the development of \texttt{ConMan}.  Components will be tested individually before being integrated into the system for system testing.
A database of test cases, test results, and action required will be maintained by the developers to ensure \texttt{ConMan} satisfies all of its major requirements.

\subsection{Testing Cases and Expected Results}
\subsubsection{Account Creation}
\textbf{Motivation:}  A user, Mr. Fat-Fingers, decides that \texttt{ConMan} sounds really cool and decides to give it a try.  Unfortunately, Mr. Fat-Fingers has difficulty typing.  After finally navigating to the account creation page, Mr. Fat-Fingers tries to create an account.  

Potential cases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item E-mail field is incorrectly entered.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Input: An invalid e-mail (a description of a valid e-mail will be determined later).
            \item Output: An error message will be displayed to the user prompting them to enter a valid e-mail address.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Account creation fields are left blank.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Input: Any of the fields for first name, last name, e-mail, or password are left blank.
            \item Output: An error message appears prompting the user to populate all of the fields.
        \end{itemize}
    \item An e-mail already in use has been entered.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Input: An e-mail already in the \texttt{ConMan} database.
            \item Output: An error message prompting the user to either enter a different e-mail or log onto existing account.
        \end{itemize}
    \item All fields are correctly entered.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Input: A unique and correctly formatted e-mail address, and all other fields are populated.
            \item Output: A user account is created and user re-directed to the \texttt{ConMan} home page.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Account Login}
\textbf{Motivation} A returning user, Ms. Forgetful, is trying to log in to her \texttt{ConMan} account.

Potential cases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item E-mail field is incorrectly entered.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Input: An improperly formatted e-mail.
            \item Output: An error message prompts Ms. Forgetful to check the formatting of her e-mail address.
        \end{itemize}
    \item E-mail is not contained in the \texttt{ConMan} database.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Input: A correctly formatted e-mail that is not associated with a user account.
            \item Output: An error message that prompts the user that her information could not be validated.
        \end{itemize}
    \item The password and e-mail combination do not match.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Input: A correctly formatted e-mail that is not associated with the given password.
            \item Output: An error message that prompts the user that her information could not be validated.
        \end{itemize}
    \item The password or e-mail fields are left blank.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Input: Either password or e-mail fields are left blank.
            \item Output: An error message that prompts the user to fill all fields.
        \end{itemize}
    \item The password and e-mail combination are valid.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Input: A correctly formatted e-mail that miraculously matches the associated password entered by Ms. Forgetful.
            \item Output: A user account is created and user re-directed to the \texttt{ConMan} home page.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Create a new team}
\textbf{Motivation} Mr. Ringleader, would like to create a new team, the "Task-buster Trio."  He has two friends who make up the trio, Mr. Fat-Fingers and Ms. Forgetful.

Potential cases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Team e-mail field is incorrectly entered.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Input: An improperly formatted e-mail.
            \item Output: An error message prompts Mr. Ringleader to check the formatting of his e-mail address.
        \end{itemize}
    \item The password or e-mail fields are left blank.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Input: Either password or e-mail fields are left blank.
            \item Output: An error message that prompts the user to fill all fields.
        \end{itemize}
    \item The e-mail field is valid and all other entries are included.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Input: A correctly formatted e-mail and all other fields are entered.  The given password and e-mail for the Task-buster Trio does not need to be the same as the e-mail or password combo for Mr. Ringleader.
            \item Output: A new team is created and Mr. Ringleader is automatically added as the administrator.
                Mr. Ringleader can now switch between his team and personal contexts within the application.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Add team members}
\textbf{Motivation} Now that Mr. Ringleader has created the "Task-buster Trio," he would like to add his two friends, Mr. Fat-Fingers and Ms. Forgetful.

Potential cases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item E-mail field is incorrectly entered.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Input: An improperly formatted e-mail.
            \item Output: An error message prompts Mr. Ringleader to check the formatting of the e-mail address.
        \end{itemize}
    \item The e-mail field is valid but no user with that e-mail is associated with a \texttt{ConMan} account.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Input: A correctly formatted e-mail with no corresponding account.

\subsubsection{Add tasks}
\textbf{Motivation} Ms. Forgetful cannot remember what she was supposed to do, except that she must add a task to her \texttt{ConMan} account.  
She opens the \texttt{ConMan} application and tries to add a task named "placeholder."

Potential cases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Ms. Forgetful is in her basic context when she clicks "add task."
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Ms. Forgetful leaves a required field blank.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Input: An task-creation entry with a blank required field.
                \item Output: An error message prompts Ms. Forgetful to include all required fields.
            \end{itemize}
        \item The date manually entered by Ms. Forgetful was for some point in the past.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Input: A task creation request with an already expired due date.
                \item Output: An error message appears telling her to pick a future date.
            \end{itemize}
        \item The e-mail field is valid and all other entries are included.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Input: A correctly formatted e-mail and all other fields are entered.
                \item Output: A task that is only visible to Ms. Forgetful is created.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\item Ms. Forgetful is in her "Task-buster Trio" context when she clicks "add task."
