FUN-TST1: Account creation
\begin{enumerate}
  \item E-mail is incorrectly entered. \\
    An error message is displayed, prompting the user to enter a valid e-mail address. (Expected Output)
  \item Account creation fields are left blank. \\

FUN-TST4: Add team members
\begin{enumerate}
  \item E-mail field is incorrectly entered. \\
    The user is prompted for a valid e-mail address.  (Expected Output)
  \item The e-mail field is valid but no user with that e-mail is associated with a \verb|ConMan| account \\
    An error is displayed which says that the user must be in the \verb|ConMan| database to be added.  (Expected Output)
  \item The e-mail field is valid and all other entries are included \\
    The user is notified that the other user has been added to the team.  They can now both see the team in their \verb|ConMan| accounts.  (Expected Output)
\end{enumerate}

FUN-TST5: Add tasks
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Alice is in her basic context when she clicks ``add task.'' \\
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Alice leaves a required field blank. \\
        \textbf{There does not seem to be a ``basic context'' for anyone, and users cannot add tasks to Teams of which they are not an admin.}

    The client is unable to access any page except for the registration page.  (Expected Output)
  \item SEC-TEST-2: Attempt to access any page in \verb|ConMan| when signed-in. \\
