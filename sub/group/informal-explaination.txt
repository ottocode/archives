What: A "program" that allows a user to use an Android phone to control a presentation.

Functionality: The user should be able to:
    1. Swipe phone to chage slides/scroll down on current slide.
    2. Act as "laser pointer" on slide.
    3. Draw on current slide (for example to circle a section of the slide).
    4. Zoom in/out of current slide.

Components:
    1. Application on Android phone that the user interacts with.
    2. Basic "power-point" program on computer (support for text and picture placement on slides).
    3. Interface mechanism between Android phone and computer running presentation.
