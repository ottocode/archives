What: A "program" that allows a user to use an Android phone to control a presentation.

Functionality: The user should be able to:
    1. Swipe phone to chage slides/scroll down on current slide.
    2. Act as "laser pointer" on slide.
    3. Draw on current slide (for example to circle a section of the slide).
    4. Zoom in/out of current slide.

Components:
    1. Application on Android phone that the user interacts with.
    2. Basic "power-point" program on computer (support for text and picture placement on slides).
    3. Interface mechanism between Android phone and computer running presentation.

                                Project Proposal
    The goal of this software engineering project is to facilitate the management of presentations through the use 
of a simple application on an Android smart phone and to create an application where users can build powerpoint-like 
presentations that can be controlled by these Android phones. The phone will act as a simple and effective control 
for the presentation. It will allow the user to easily “connect” to a presentation so that it can perform a variety 
of tasks such as: using the phone to act as “laser pointer”, to draw, to change slides and scroll by swiping phone, 
and to zoom in/out on current slide. 
	The project will have three main components: an application on Android phone, a basic “power-point” program on 
computer, and a server which will facilitate communication between the smart phone and the compute program.
    Below is a simple diagram showing the relationship between the 3 components:
