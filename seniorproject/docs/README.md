Documents for senior project
===========================

These are the documents for the senior project, but not necessarily for the nocc compiler (although there are many cases of overlap).

Note for the grammer documents:  All symbols are non-terminals unless preceeded by a `/`.  The optional symbols are preceeded by a `\`.
