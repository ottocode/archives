Nick - Nick's Idealized C Kernel
================================

So, creating a compiler is hard.  It is especially hard for a full-featured language like C.  
For this part of the project, I will be implementing increasing portions of the C language and compiling those.

With the encouragement of some friends, I have changed the name to incorporate some of my name into the name of the language  :)
