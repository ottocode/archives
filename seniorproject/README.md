seniorproject
=============

The central repository for my senior project.

The general outline of work is as follows:

  1. Create a C compiler that targets the Raspberry Pi.
  2. Build a basic operating system in C using my compiler. 

However, the primary focus will be on simply creating the compier.
The operating system will have to come later.
