Resources
========

Resources for my senior project.  Mostly interesting in raspberry pi references as well as some tutorials.  Also, an ARM compiler to compare against.

The knuth-mmix is a folder containing the source for Donald Knuth's MMIX computer.  (well actually it is the specification of the computer and an interpreter program for it).  The assembly language, mmixal is a candidate for the intermediate representation for my compiler.
