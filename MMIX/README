MMIX work that I have done.

beer.mms Is a program I found on the internet.  The author's information is at the top of the program.  I have it here as a useful reference.

Most of this here will have been created for USD's Comp 280, Introduction to Assembly Language

There are multiple issues with some of the programs, they are presented here not for accuracy, but for learning purposes.

"I don't always code in assembly, but when I do,
    I use MMIX."
