My thoughts on starting this in Racket

Started with the stats functions, pretty straightforward, lots of parameters though... Can I use "global" variables that aren't defined in the function header?

Random functions, no big deal.

Figured out a way to sort both arrival and departure events (essentially the same thing, but they need to be distinct).  That was pretty cool, but semms a bit non-lispy.
